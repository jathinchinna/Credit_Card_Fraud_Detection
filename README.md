# Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning

Fraud detection plays a critical role in minimizing financial losses and enhancing transaction security. This project evaluates and compares multiple machine learning models to determine the most effective approach for detecting fraudulent activities.

📌 Project Overview

In this study, the following machine learning models were implemented and evaluated:

🌲 Random Forest

📍 k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)

📈 Logistic Regression

📊 Naïve Bayes


Each model was assessed using standard performance metrics:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1-Score



🏆 Best Performing Model: Random Forest

Random Forest emerged as the most effective model for fraud detection due to:

✅ 99% Accuracy

✅ 100% Precision

✅ Strong and balanced performance across all evaluation metrics

✅ Ability to handle complex and non-linear patterns

✅ Robustness against overfitting

✅ Feature importance insights for better interpretability




⚖️ Model Comparison Insights

🔹 k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)

Delivered reasonable performance.

Limited recall in some cases.

Less effective in handling complex non-linear relationships.


🔹 Logistic Regression

Performed adequately on structured data.

Struggled with non-linear decision boundaries.


🔹 Naïve Bayes

Computationally efficient.

Performance affected by feature dependency assumptions.

Lower effectiveness on correlated features.




🎯 Conclusion

Random Forest proved to be the most reliable and accurate model for fraud detection in this study. Its strong predictive power, balanced performance metrics, and resilience against overfitting make it an ideal choice for real-world fraud detection systems.
